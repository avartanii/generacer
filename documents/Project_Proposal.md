# Project Proposal
## Description

Generacer is an online web application designed to test the ability of custom natural language processing to parse a specific syntax, calculate a certain result, and display that result. In this case, Generacer will receive input from the results of a horse race. Using the numerical data such as the placings and distances between each horse, the track length, and total race time, as well as the natural language data summarizing the individual horses’ performances, Generacer will render its best interpretation of what the race looked like.

The Generacer web application has 2 main functions:

1. Enter Race Data
    - The data entrance will occur in browser with a specifically designed user interface to allow quick and efficient entry while avoiding the obvious tediousness that could arise from entering the mass amount of specific information that comes with each race.


2. Rendering the Race
    - Use the entered race data to calculate a close representation to the original race.


3. Display the Race
    - Use JavaScript in browser animations to display the rendered representation and interpreted data.

Generacer’s end users are a niche crowd of horse racing and artificial intelligence enthusiasts. This is an application for, as of right now, a crowd of two people, the designer and the proposer. Past this semester, if future development occurs, I hope to be able to create a database that stores past races as well as individual horses’ performances, in an effort to possibly predict the outcome of future races.

## Justification
I believe the project allows me to harness the computer science education I have received at LMU in the past three-and-a-half years, hone their application further than I did in CMSI 401, and learn more about certain topics that I have not received a formal education on (e.g. natural language processing).

I will be implementing my frontend education, gained through Interaction Design and Graphics, to create an intuitive and elegant web interface to mirror the characteristics of the horse racing sport. I will also attempt to use what I learn in my concurrent Artificial Intelligence course to parse the data.

Lastly, I want to create Generacer because to me it seems like pure fun. I love problems like this and want one last chance to attempt and conquer one before going on to a daily routine career (at least in the immediate future). Also, I want to create Generacer because it was proposed and challenged to me by Dr. Dorin, one of my favorite professors here at LMU. I have always found his attitude toward such puzzles intriguing and parallel to mine and dare to try and make him proud by accomplishing one he seems very interested in seeing solved.
