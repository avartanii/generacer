Generacer  Project SRS Evaluation
=================================

Nice job on this, very complete.

Some suggestions.

When thinking of requirements, try to be even more specific about what 
you are specifying.  Try to make sure your requirements are "quantified"
and don't use words like "minimal"; instead use "less than n seconds".

Also, the database section needs a little more "meat" to specify what
is actually stored there.  You don't need to specify the database engine
for an SRS; that is more the "HOW" not the "WHAT"...

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
